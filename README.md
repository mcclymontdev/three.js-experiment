# Three.js Experiment

I was interested in how animated backgrounds worked in JavaScript ([Vanta.js](https://www.vantajs.com/) to be specific), from there I discovered the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library.  
Feel free to use the code as you please, the workflow is relatively simple and easy to follow.

## Main Features

- Particle render using a generated sprite and torus knot geometry.
- Camera angle based on mouse movement.
- Canvas/renderer adjustment on window resize.
